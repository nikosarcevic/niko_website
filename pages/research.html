                    I am a cosmologist focusing on intrinsic alignments of galaxies in weak lensing measurements, 
                    exploring their impact on late-time cosmology. My work involves statistical modeling, 
                    systematics mitigation, and advancing methods for precision cosmology.

                    Currently based at Duke University, I contribute to the LSST DESC and collaborate 
                    on research that addresses key challenges in modern astrophysics, including galaxy bias, 
                    weak lensing, and dark energy.
                </p>

                    I am also part of the <b>NASA Roman Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT)</b>, where 
                    I focus on cosmological inference and weak lensing analysis, further enhancing our understanding 
                    of the universe through collaborative efforts and cutting-edge methodologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My previous work includes contributions to the <b>XENON collaboration</b>, where I designed 
                    key components of the XENONnT detector, including the electric field cage, to aid in dark matter 
                    detection experiments.
