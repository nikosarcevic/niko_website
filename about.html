				        I am Niko Sarcevic, a cosmologist with a deep interest in mitigating the effects of astrophysical systematics,
					their modeling, and understanding their interplay. I am also passionate about improving coding practices in science,
					promoting reproducibility, ensuring accessibility of scientific analyses, and exploring the potential of combined probes
					in cosmology.

				        I obtained my undergraduate degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the University of Novi Sad in 2014. My thesis, 
				        titled "<a href="https://www.df.uns.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/publikacije/nikolina_sarcevic_-_diplomski_rad_(d-658).pdf" target="_blank">
				        Research of Photoneutron Energy Spectrum by 115In Activation</a>", focused on nuclear physics applied to nuclear medicine.

				        Following my undergraduate studies, I was part of the AstroMundus Master program, a two-year international course that 
				        provided opportunities to study at several universities, including the University of Innsbruck, University of Padova, and 
				        University of GÃ¶ttingen. I completed my master's thesis at the University of Padova in 2017, titled 
				        "<a href="https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/25665?1/sarcevic_tesi.pdf" target="_blank">
				        Population of Gamma-ray Sources in the Third Fermi LAT Catalog</a>".

				        In September 2017, I joined the University of Freiburg in Germany to pursue a PhD as part of the XENON collaboration. 
				        My contributions included electric field simulations and R&D, where I designed the electric field cage of the XENONnT detector. 
				        Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, I had to discontinue my studies after two years.

				        In 2020, I joined the cosmology group at Newcastle University in the UK, where I specialized in weak lensing cosmology 
				        with a focus on systematic modeling, mitigation, and cosmological inference. My doctoral thesis, 
				        "<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14602273" target="_blank">
				        Modelling and Mitigating the Systematics in Weak Lensing Measurements</a>", highlights these efforts.

				        Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University in the United States, continuing my work in cosmology. 
				        I am an active member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) and NASA Roman Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team. 
				        Within DESC, I co-lead the updated cosmology forecast for LSST and manage all other forecasting efforts of the collaboration.
